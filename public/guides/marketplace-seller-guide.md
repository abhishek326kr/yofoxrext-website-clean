# Marketplace Seller Guide

Selling EAs, indicators, or articles? Here's how to do it right: fair pricing, honest claims, quality screenshots, and good support. Follow these rules to build a great reputation and avoid issues.

## Quick Wins

- **Honest claims only** – don't promise what you can't deliver
- **Quality screenshots** – show real results, not photoshopped perfection
- **Test before selling** – don't sell broken products
- **Support your buyers** – reply to questions within 24 hours
- **Fair pricing** – research similar products first

## Before You List

### 1. Test Your Product Thoroughly

**Minimum testing:**
- Backtest on at least 3 different pairs/timeframes
- Forward test on demo for at least 1 month
- Test on 2-3 different broker accounts (spreads vary)
- Verify it works on both MT4 and MT5 if claiming compatibility
- Check for errors in different market conditions (volatile, ranging, news)

**Don't sell if:**
- You haven't tested it yourself
- It only works with unrealistic settings (0.1 pip spread, zero slippage)
- It blows accounts regularly
- You can't replicate the results shown
- It contains known bugs you haven't fixed

### 2. Prepare Quality Materials

**Required before listing:**
- Clear product description (what it does, how it works)
- 3+ high-quality screenshots (chart, settings, results)
- Backtest report (MT5 strategy tester HTML export or screenshots)
- Setup instructions (PDF or text document)
- List of requirements (platform, broker type, minimum deposit, leverage)

**Nice to have:**
- Video tutorial (setup or overview)
- Forward test results (MyFXBook link)
- User testimonials (if you beta tested with others)
- Comparison with similar products

## Listing Your Product

### 1. Write an Honest Title and Description

**Title formula:**
[Product Name] v[Version] – [Platform] [Pair/Multi-Pair] [Timeframe] [Strategy Type]

**Examples:**
- "Gold Hedger Pro v2.1 – MT5 XAUUSD M5 Grid EA"
- "RSI Divergence Detector v1.4 – MT4 Multi-Pair H4 Indicator"
- "Complete Backtesting Guide for Grid EAs – Article"

**Description structure:**
1. What it does (1-2 sentences)
2. How it works (strategy logic)
3. Requirements (platform, deposit, broker type)
4. Results (backtest + forward test with settings)
5. Risks and disclaimers
6. Support offered

**What NOT to claim:**
- Guaranteed profits
- 100% win rate
- Zero risk
- "Best EA ever"
- "Holy grail"
- "Get rich quick"

### 2. Set Fair Pricing

**Research first**: Search for similar products. Check their:
- Features vs your product
- Pricing (convert to USD: 100 coins = $5.50)
- Reviews and ratings
- Sales volume

**Pricing guidelines:**

**EAs:**
- Basic/simple: 200-400 coins ($11-$22)
- Intermediate: 400-800 coins ($22-$44)
- Advanced with features: 800-1,500 coins ($44-$82)
- Professional/institutional: 1,500+ coins ($82+)

**Indicators:**
- Simple: 100-300 coins ($5.50-$16.50)
- Multi-timeframe: 300-600 coins ($16.50-$33)
- Advanced with alerts: 600-1,000 coins ($33-$55)

**Articles/Guides:**
- Short (1,000-2,000 words): Free or 50-100 coins ($2.75-$5.50)
- Comprehensive (3,000+ words): 100-300 coins ($5.50-$16.50)
- With templates/code: 300-500 coins ($16.50-$27.50)

**Set Files:**
- Optimized settings: 50-150 coins ($2.75-$8.25)
- Multiple pair sets: 150-300 coins ($8.25-$16.50)

**Pro tip**: Price slightly below competitors when starting. Build reputation first, then raise prices.

### 3. Upload Quality Screenshots

**Screenshot #1: Chart in Action**
- Show indicators plotted or trades on chart
- Include timeframe and pair in chart
- Use professional-looking chart template
- Don't clutter with too many indicators

**Screenshot #2: Settings Panel**
- Show EA/indicator input parameters
- Highlight key settings or defaults
- Make text readable (high resolution)

**Screenshot #3: Results**
- Backtest equity curve
- Or MyFXBook performance page
- Or trade history showing profit/loss

**Screenshot tips:**
- Minimum 1280x720 resolution
- No watermarks from other sites
- Crop out irrelevant parts
- Annotate if needed (arrows, labels in image editor)
- Don't photoshop results

### 4. Write Clear Requirements

**Template to copy:**

"**Requirements:**
- Platform: MT5 build 3260 or newer
- Minimum deposit: $1,000 (for 0.01 lot starting size)
- Leverage: 1:500 recommended (works on 1:200+)
- Broker type: ECN with raw spreads preferred
- Spread: XAUUSD spread <$0.25 recommended
- VPS: Recommended for 24/7 operation
- Experience: Intermediate (understand risk management)"

Be specific. Vague requirements cause bad reviews.

### 5. Include Risk Disclosure

**Required disclaimer (customize to your product):**

"**Risk Disclosure:**
- Maximum observed drawdown: [X]% (during backtesting)
- Past results don't guarantee future performance
- Grid/Martingale strategies can experience large drawdowns
- Requires monitoring during high-impact news events
- Not suitable for beginners or small accounts under [X]
- Trading involves risk of loss—never risk more than you can afford to lose"

Honest disclosure builds trust and reduces refund requests.

## After Listing: Seller Responsibilities

### 1. Respond to Questions Fast

**Buyers ask questions before purchasing:**
- Answer within 24 hours (faster is better)
- Be helpful and detailed
- Don't get defensive about criticism
- If you don't know, admit it and research

**Tip**: Enable email notifications for product questions.

### 2. Support Buyers After Purchase

**Provide:**
- Setup help if they struggle
- Answer questions about settings
- Help troubleshoot if EA doesn't behave as expected
- Explain differences between backtest and live results

**Response time**: Aim for <24 hours. Faster support = better reviews.

### 3. Update Products When Needed

**Update when:**
- Broker conditions change (spreads, execution)
- Platform updates break compatibility
- You find and fix a bug
- You add new features

**Version updates:**
- Mark clearly what changed (v1.1 → v1.2)
- Offer free updates to existing buyers
- Announce updates in product comments

### 4. Handle Negative Reviews Professionally

**If you get a bad review:**
1. Don't get defensive
2. Read the complaint carefully
3. If it's a valid bug, acknowledge and fix
4. If it's user error, offer to help troubleshoot
5. Reply publicly (shows future buyers you care)

**Good response example:**
"Thanks for the feedback. I see the issue—you're using 1:100 leverage but this EA requires 1:500+ to manage trades properly. I should have made that clearer. I've updated the description. Happy to refund if it doesn't meet your needs."

**Bad response example:**
"You just don't know how to use it. Works fine for me."

## Marketplace Rules You Must Follow

**DO:**
- Sell only your own work or properly licensed content

## Pricing Strategy Tips

**Strategy 1: Freemium**
- Offer free "lite" version with basic features
- Sell "pro" version with advanced features
- Builds trust, increases exposure

**Strategy 2: Launch Discount**
- Price low initially to get first 10-20 sales
- Raise price after building reviews
- Reward early adopters

**Strategy 3: Bundle Pricing**
- Sell multiple products as package
- Offer discount for bundle vs individual
- Example: "Grid EA + Indicator + Settings = 1,200 coins (save 300)"

- One-time purchase includes 1 year of updates
- After 1 year, optional renewal for continued updates
- Good for products that need frequent updates

## Mini-FAQ

**Q: Can I sell the same product on other platforms?**  
A: Yes, but don't copy-paste content from other sites (looks lazy and hurts SEO). Rewrite descriptions uniquely for YoForex.

**Q: What percentage does YoForex take?**  
A: 20% platform fee. You keep 80% of each sale in coins.

**Q: Can I offer refunds?**  
A: Yes, and encouraged if product doesn't work as described. Contact support to process refunds. Fair refund policy builds reputation.

**Q: How do I handle someone reselling my EA?**  
A: Report it immediately. We take intellectual property theft seriously. Provide proof of original listing and we'll remove the copy.

**Q: Should I provide source code (.mq4/.mq5) or compiled (.ex4/.ex5)?**  
A: Compiled is standard. Source code commands higher prices but requires more trust. Most sellers do compiled unless selling to developers.

**Q: What if my EA stops working after a broker changes their spread?**  
A: Update your product with new recommended settings. Notify existing buyers. This shows you support your product long-term.
