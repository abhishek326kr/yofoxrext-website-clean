# Forum Rules

Welcome to YoForex! These rules keep our community helpful, respectful, and focused on what matters: trading better together.

## Quick Wins

- Be helpful and respectful in every post
- Search before posting to avoid duplicates
- Stay on topic in each category
- Share real results, not promises or hype
- No spam, self-promotion, or affiliate links

## The Rules

1. **Be respectful**: Disagree with ideas, not people. No insults, no trolling, no personal attacks.

2. **Stay on topic**: Post in the right category. EA questions go in EA forums, broker reviews in Broker Directory, etc.

3. **No spam**: Don't post the same thing multiple times. One thread is enough. No affiliate links unless you're answering a direct question.

4. **Share real proof**: If you claim results, show proof. Screenshots, backtests, broker statements (with sensitive info blurred).

5. **Give credit**: If you use someone's code, indicator, or EA, mention them. It's the right thing to do.

6. **No scams**: Don't sell fake signals, rigged EAs, or promise guaranteed returns. We'll remove it and you.

7. **Use clear titles**: Help people find your thread. Instead of "Help!", write "EURUSD H1 â€“ EA stops after 3 trades".

8. **Be patient**: People answer when they can. Bumping your thread every hour won't help.

## Mini-FAQ

**Q: What happens if I break a rule?**  
A: First time, we'll send a warning. Repeat offenses get temporary bans. Serious stuff (scams, abuse) gets you removed.

**Q: Can I promote my paid EA or service?**  
A: Only in the Marketplace section, and you must follow seller guidelines. No DM spam.

**Q: What if someone is being rude to me?**  
A: Don't engage. Use the Report button or contact a moderator. We'll handle it.

**Q: Can I post affiliate links?**  
A: No, unless someone specifically asks for a broker recommendation and you disclose it's an affiliate link.

**Q: I made a mistake in my post. Can I fix it?**  
A: Yes! Edit your post within 24 hours. After that, reply with a correction.
