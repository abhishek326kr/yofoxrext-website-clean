# New Member Quickstart

Welcome to YoForex! Here's how to post your first thread without overthinking it. Follow these steps, and you'll get helpful replies fast.

## Quick Wins

- **Pick the right category** – be specific, not general
- **Write a clear title** – include pair and timeframe
- **State your question** – one clear question per thread
- **Add context** – what you tried, what happened
- **Attach proof** – screenshot or chart if relevant

## Your First Thread in 5 Minutes

### Step 1: Choose the Right Category (1 minute)

Don't post in "General Discussion" unless you're really unsure. Use specific categories:

**Common first posts:**
- EA question → **EA Library**
- Strategy help → **Trading Strategies**
- Broker question → **Broker Reviews**
- Code help → **Coding & Development**
- Learning question → **Education & Resources**

**Pro tip**: Subcategories exist. If discussing XAUUSD scalping, go to **Trading Strategies → Scalping → XAUUSD** for the best audience.

### Step 2: Write a Clear Title (1 minute)

**Bad first-post titles:**
- "Help me"
- "Question about trading"
- "Is this normal?"

**Good first-post titles:**
- "XAUUSD M5 – Grid EA stops opening trades after 5 wins"
- "EURUSD H1 – Which broker has lowest spread for swing trading?"
- "MT5 – How to install .ex5 EA file correctly?"

**Formula: [Pair/Topic] [Timeframe/Platform] – specific question or problem**

### Step 3: Start with Context (1 minute)

**Template to copy:**

"I'm [experience level] trader working with [what you're testing].

I'm trying to [what you want to achieve].

I've tried [what you already attempted].

Problem: [what's not working or what you're confused about].

Question: [one clear question]?"

**Real example:**

"I'm a beginner trader working with a free grid EA on XAUUSD.

I'm trying to backtest it on MT5 before using real money.

I've tried running the strategy tester, but results show 0 trades executed even though the EA is active.

Problem: The EA doesn't open any trades during backtesting, but I don't see any errors.

Question: What strategy tester settings do I need to change to make the EA execute trades?"

### Step 4: Add Screenshots or Proof (1 minute)

If you have visuals, add them. Screenshots massively increase reply speed.

**What to screenshot:**
- Chart showing your issue
- EA settings panel
- Backtest results
- Error messages
- Broker trading conditions page

**How to attach**: When creating thread, click "Attach Files" button and upload .jpg or .png files.

**No screenshot?** No problem. Just describe clearly in text.

### Step 5: Fill Out Metadata (Optional, 30 seconds)

When posting, you'll see optional fields:
- **Instrument/Pair**: Select from dropdown (e.g., XAUUSD, EURUSD)
- **Timeframe**: M1, M5, H1, D1, etc.
- **Broker**: Your broker name
- **Strategy**: Grid, Martingale, MA Cross, etc.

**Why bother?** You earn bonus coins (+10 base + up to +12 bonus). Plus, your thread shows up in filtered searches.

**First post and don't know?** Skip it. You can still post without metadata.

### Step 6: Review and Post (30 seconds)

Before clicking "Post Thread":
- Does your title make sense?
- Is your question clear?
- Did you include what you already tried?

Yes? Hit "Post Thread" and you're done!

## After Posting: What to Expect

**First replies**: Usually within 1-6 hours, depending on time of day.

**What to do when someone replies:**
1. **Read carefully** – they took time to help
2. **Reply with results** – "I tried this, it worked!" or "Still stuck, here's what happened..."
3. **Ask follow-up if needed** – but one question at a time
4. **Mark accepted answer** – when someone solves your problem, mark their reply as "accepted answer" (they get +15 coins!)

**If nobody replies in 24 hours:**
- Add more details (what you tried since posting)
- Add screenshots if you didn't before
- Check if you posted in the right category

## Common First-Post Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

**Mistake 1: Too vague**
❌ "EA not working"  
✅ "XAUUSD M5 Grid EA opens only 1 trade then stops – settings look correct"

**Mistake 2: Multiple questions in one thread**
❌ "How do I install EA, which broker is best, and should I use VPS?"  
✅ Pick ONE question. Ask others in separate threads.

**Mistake 3: No context**
❌ "Why doesn't this work?" (with screenshot)  
✅ "I'm testing this MA cross EA on EURUSD H1. It should open trades when fast MA crosses slow MA, but it's not opening anything. Here's my chart:"

**Mistake 4: Demanding instant answers**
❌ "URGENT! Need answer NOW!"  
✅ Just ask politely. People help when they can.

**Mistake 5: Not replying to helpers**
❌ Post question → get replies → disappear  
✅ Post question → get replies → test their suggestions → report back

## Quick Etiquette Tips

- Mark accepted answer when solved

## Mini-FAQ
