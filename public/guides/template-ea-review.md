## How to Write a Fair Review

### 1. Test Long Enough

**Minimum testing time:**
- Simple strategies (MA cross, breakout): 2-4 weeks
- Grid/Martingale EAs: 4-8 weeks (need to see drawdown cycles)
- Long-term swing EAs: 8-12 weeks

**Why**: One good week doesn't prove anything. You need to see how the EA handles different market conditions.

### 2. Use Real Metrics

**Don't say:**
- "Made good money"
- "Worked pretty well"
- "Some losses but overall positive"

**Do say:**
- "+$340 profit on $2,000 account (17% ROI)"
- "65% win rate over 87 trades"
- "Max drawdown hit 18% during NFP week"

Numbers = credibility.

### 3. Be Honest About Cons

Every EA has weaknesses. Mentioning them makes your review more trustworthy.

**Good reviews include:**
- What the EA struggles with
- When it performed poorly
- What could be improved
- Who shouldn't use it

### 4. Compare to Claims

**Check seller's listing:**
- What win rate did they claim?
- What drawdown did they show?
- What account size did they recommend?

**In your review, say if results matched, exceeded, or fell short.**

### 5. Include Context

**Your review is more helpful when you explain:**
- Your experience level
- Your risk tolerance
- Your broker and spread
- Your account size
- Any custom settings you used

Two traders can get different results with the same EA because of these factors.

## What Makes a Great Review

✅ **Tested for adequate time** (weeks, not days)  
✅ **Specific metrics** (%, $, trade counts)  
✅ **Both pros and cons** (balanced)  
✅ **Screenshots or proof** (equity curve, statement)  
✅ **Fair tone** (fact-based, not emotional)  
✅ **Helpful tips** for other testers  
✅ **Clear recommendation** (who should/shouldn't use it)

## What Ruins a Review

❌ **Too soon** ("tested for 2 days")  
❌ **Vague** ("worked great!")  
❌ **Emotional** ("this EA SUCKS!")  
❌ **No proof** (no screenshots, no metrics)  
❌ **Unrealistic** ("100% win rate!")  
❌ **One-sided** (only pros or only cons)  
❌ **Off-topic** (complaining about broker, not EA)

A: Yes. Edit your post if you have new results after more testing. Add "Update:" section at the top.
