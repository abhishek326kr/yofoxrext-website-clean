# Safe Download Guide

Downloading EAs, indicators, and files from the community? Smart move. Doing it safely? Even smarter. Here's how to protect yourself and your trading setup.

## Quick Wins

- **Scan everything** – use antivirus before opening any file
- **Check the uploader** – look for badges, reviews, and history
- **Read reviews first** – see what others experienced
- **Backup before testing** – save your MT4/MT5 folder first
- **Test on demo first** – never live account testing with new EAs

## How to Download Safely

1. **Check the uploader's reputation**: Look at their badges, join date, and previous uploads. Users with "Trusted Seller" or "Veteran" badges have earned community trust. New accounts with zero history? Proceed with caution.

2. **Read all reviews and ratings**: Don't just look at the star rating. Read actual reviews. Look for patterns: Do multiple people report the same issue? Are reviews detailed or just generic "great EA!" comments?

3. **Download to a quarantine folder**: Create a separate folder on your computer just for new downloads. Don't put them straight into your MT4/MT5 directory yet.

4. **Scan with antivirus**: Run a full scan on the file before opening. Even if someone says it's clean, scan it yourself. Free tools like Windows Defender work fine.

5. **Check file size and type**: EAs are typically .ex4 or .ex5 files (10-500 KB usually). If you download an .exe file or something massive, that's suspicious. Indicators are .mq4/.mq5 or .ex4/.ex5. Set files are .set (tiny, just text).

6. **Backup your terminal first**: Before installing anything new, copy your entire MetaTrader folder to a backup location. If something goes wrong, you can restore it instantly.

7. **Test on demo account only**: Install the EA on a demo account first. Watch it for at least 3-5 days. Check if it behaves as described. Monitor CPU usage and terminal stability.

8. **Verify EA settings match description**: Compare the EA parameters to what the uploader described. If they mentioned specific settings for XAUUSD M5, make sure those settings exist and match.

## What to Avoid

**Red flags to watch for:**
- Requests for admin passwords or system access
- EAs that want to modify your broker settings
- Files that try to connect to unknown external servers
- Uploaders who pressure you to "act fast" or "limited time"
- EAs that promise guaranteed returns with zero risk
- Downloads that come with extra software or installers

## Mini-FAQ

**Q: Is it safe to download free EAs?**  
A: Generally yes, but follow all safety steps. Free doesn't mean risky, and paid doesn't mean safe. Check reputation and reviews either way.

**Q: What if my antivirus flags an EA?**  
A: Sometimes legitimate EAs get false positives. Check reviews to see if others had the same issue. When in doubt, don't use it or ask in the forum.

**Q: Can an EA access my trading account?**  
A: EAs can only do what you authorize in MT4/MT5 settings. They can't access your broker password or withdraw money. They can place trades if you enable AutoTrade.

**Q: Should I share my purchased EA with friends?**  
A: No, that violates seller rights and platform rules. If your friend wants it, they should purchase it themselves. Sharing gets both accounts flagged.

**Q: What if an EA isn't working as described?**  
A: First, double-check you installed it correctly and used the recommended settings. If it still fails, contact the seller through the platform. If they don't respond, leave an honest review and report the issue.
