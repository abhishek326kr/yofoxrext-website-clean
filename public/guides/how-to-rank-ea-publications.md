# How to Rank EA Publications

Your EA works. Now make sure traders find it, trust it, and buy it. Proper titles, proof, and honesty get you ranked higher and drive more downloads.

## Quick Wins

- **Title format**: EA Name + version + platform + pair/timeframe
- **What it does in 1 sentence** – no hype, just facts
- **Show requirements** – minimum deposit, leverage, platform version
- **Real proof required** – backtest + forward test results
- **3+ screenshots** – chart, settings, results graph
- **5-8 relevant tags** – specific search terms
- **Be honest about risks** – builds trust, improves ranking

## Build a Ranking-Friendly Title

**Bad titles:**
- "Best EA Ever"
- "Profitable Robot"
- "Make Money Fast EA"

**Good titles:**
- "Gold Grid Pro v2.3 – MT5 XAUUSD M5 Hedging EA"
- "MA Cross Scalper v1.8 – MT4 EURUSD M1 High-Frequency"
- "Swing Trader Elite v3.0 – MT5 Multi-Pair H4 Strategy"

**Title formula: [EA Name] [Version] – [Platform] [Pair/Pairs] [Timeframe] [Strategy Type]**

This format helps:
- Search engines understand what you offer
- Traders find exactly what they need
- You appear in filtered searches

### 1. Describe What It Does (One Sentence)

Don't start with marketing fluff. Start with function:

**Examples:**
- "Opens buy and sell grid orders on XAUUSD M5, hedges with opposite trades when drawdown hits 15%"
- "Scalps EURUSD M1 using 20/50 MA crossover with 10-pip stop loss and 15-pip take profit"
- "Swings GBPUSD H4 based on RSI divergence, trailing stop activated after 30 pips profit"

One sentence tells traders: "This is what it does. Is this what I need?" If yes, they keep reading.

### 2. List Requirements Clearly

Don't make traders guess:

**Required info:**
- **Platform**: MT4 or MT5 (specify build number if critical)
- **Minimum deposit**: e.g., "$500 minimum for 0.01 lot sizing"
- **Leverage**: e.g., "1:500 leverage required" or "Works on 1:100+"
- **Spread**: e.g., "Requires ECN broker with <2 pip spread"
- **Broker type**: ECN, Market Maker, specific brokers if applicable
- **VPS recommended**: Yes/No and why

**Example:**

"**Requirements:**
- MT5 build 3260+
- $1,000 minimum (for 0.01 micro lots)
- 1:500 leverage
- ECN broker with XAUUSD spread <$0.20
- VPS recommended for 24/7 operation"

### 3. Show Proof (Backtest + Forward Test)

**Minimum proof to include:**
- Backtest results (MT5 strategy tester screenshot)
- Settings used during backtest
- Backtest period (e.g., "Jan 2023 - Dec 2024")
- Forward test results (live or demo, at least 1 month)
- Statement link from MyFXBook or similar (if available)

**What NOT to do:**
- Photoshop fake results
- Cherry-pick only winning periods
- Hide drawdown or losing streaks
- Use unrealistic settings (0.1 pip spread, zero slippage)

Honest proof ranks better long-term. Fake proof gets reported and removed.

### 4. Add Quality Screenshots (3+ Required)

**Must-have screenshots:**
1. **Chart with indicators/trades**: Show the EA in action on a chart
2. **Settings panel**: Screenshot of input parameters
3. **Results graph**: Equity curve or profit graph from strategy tester

**Nice-to-have screenshots:**
4. Live account statement (blur account number)
5. Trade history log
6. MyFXBook analytics page

**Image tips:**
- Use high resolution (at least 1280x720)
- Crop out irrelevant parts
- Annotate if needed (arrows, labels)
- No watermarks from other sites

### 5. Use Strategic Tags (5-8 Tags)

**Good tags (specific):**
- #XAUUSD, #grid-trading, #MT5, #hedging, #scalping, #M5, #ECN-broker, #low-risk

**Bad tags (too generic or spammy):**
- #best, #profit, #money, #forex, #trading, #EA

**Tag strategy:**
- Include pair/instrument (e.g., #XAUUSD, #EURUSD)
- Include strategy type (e.g., #grid, #martingale, #scalping)
- Include timeframe (e.g., #M5, #H1, #D1)
- Include platform (e.g., #MT5, #MT4)
- Include special features (e.g., #hedging, #trailing-stop, #news-filter)

### 6. Write Honest Risk Disclosure

This builds trust AND improves ranking (platform favors transparent sellers):

**Example risk section:**

"**Risks:**
- Maximum observed drawdown: 28% during high volatility
- Grid EAs can experience extended losing periods
- Requires monitoring during major news events
- Not suitable for accounts under $1,000
- Past performance does not guarantee future results"

Honest disclosure = fewer refund requests = better seller reputation = higher ranking.

### 7. Include Version History and Updates

Show you maintain your EA:

**Example:**

"**Version History:**
- v2.3 (Jan 2025): Added news filter, fixed lot sizing bug
- v2.2 (Dec 2024): Improved trailing stop logic
- v2.1 (Nov 2024): Initial public release"

Active development signals quality. Traders trust EAs that get updates.

### 8. Offer Support and Documentation

**Include:**
- Setup instructions (step-by-step)
- Recommended settings for different account sizes
- FAQ section
- Support contact method (DM, thread replies, etc.)

**Example:**

"**Support:**
- Reply to comments within 24 hours
- Setup guide included in download
- Free settings optimization for first 30 buyers
- DM me for questions anytime"

Good support = good reviews = higher ranking.

## Pricing Strategy for Ranking

**Free EAs:**
- Get more downloads quickly
- Build reputation faster
- Great for new sellers

**Paid EAs:**
- 100-300 coins: Budget tier (beginners)
- 300-700 coins: Mid tier (proven strategies)
- 700-1,500 coins: Premium tier (advanced, well-tested)
- 1,500+ coins: Elite tier (institutional-grade, full support)

**Pro tip**: Offer a free "lite" version and a paid "pro" version. Free version builds trust, pro version generates revenue.

## What Hurts Your Ranking

**Avoid these mistakes:**
- Misleading titles ("100% win rate")
- No proof or fake screenshots
- Ignoring support requests
- Breaking after updates (test before releasing)
- Bad reviews from bugs (test thoroughly)
- Stolen or decompiled code
- Overpromising results

## Mini-FAQ

**Q: Should I offer a money-back guarantee?**  
A: Optional, but it reduces risk for buyers and can increase sales. Just clearly state conditions (e.g., "Refund if EA doesn't perform as described within 7 days").

**Q: How long until my EA ranks well?**  
A: Quality EAs with proof and good reviews can rank within 2-4 weeks. Sales and downloads accelerate ranking.

**Q: Can I update my EA listing after publishing?**  
A: Yes! Update with new versions, improved screenshots, additional proof. Active listings rank better.

**Q: What if I get a bad review?**  
A: Respond professionally. If it's a valid bug, fix it and update. If it's user error, offer to help. Your response shows future buyers you care.

**Q: Should I include .ex4/.ex5 or .mq4/.mq5 source?**  
A: .ex4/.ex5 (compiled) is standard. Source code (.mq4/.mq5) commands higher prices but requires more trust. Most sellers do compiled only.

## End Note

If you want feedback on your EA listing before publishing, post a draft in **EA Library → EA Publishing Discussion** and ask for review. The community will help you optimize it for maximum visibility.
