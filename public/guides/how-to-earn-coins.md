## Pro Tips

**1. Quality over quantity**: One detailed thread earns more than five low-effort ones. Take time to add metadata, screenshots, and context.

**2. Answer new threads first**: Get in early with helpful replies before others do. First helpful reply often gets accepted answer status.

**3. Build reputation**: Higher reputation increases visibility, which means more upvotes and opportunities.

**4. Specialize**: Become known for expertise in one area (e.g., XAUUSD EAs, MQL5 coding, backtest analysis). Specialist answers get more upvotes.

**5. Consistency wins**: Daily check-in streaks and regular posting compound over time. 30-day streak bonus alone is 50 coins.
