# How to Get Your Thread Seen

You spent time writing a thread. Now make sure people actually find it. These tweaks boost visibility and get you faster, better replies.

## Quick Wins

- **Title formula works**: [Instrument] [Timeframe] – what you tried
- **Add metadata**: instrument, timeframe, broker, rules, results
- **Use 2-5 tags**: specific terms people search for
- **Attach screenshots**: charts, settings, backtest results
- **Link related threads**: shows you did research

## Step-by-Step Visibility Boost

### 1. Write a Searchable Title

**Bad titles nobody clicks:**
- "Help!"
- "EA not working"
- "Question about trading"

**Good titles that get clicks:**
- "XAUUSD M5 – Grid EA stops after 3 winning trades"
- "EURUSD H1 – MA cross indicator repaints on close"
- "IC Markets – Slippage issues during NFP news"

**Title formula: [Instrument/Pair] [Timeframe] – specific problem or result**

### 2. Add Complete Metadata

When creating your thread, fill out these fields:
- **Instrument**: XAUUSD, EURUSD, etc. (+2 coins bonus)
- **Timeframe**: M1, M5, H1, D1, etc. (+2 coins bonus)
- **Broker**: IC Markets, Pepperstone, etc. (+1 coin bonus)
- **Trading strategy/rules**: Grid, Martingale, MA Cross, etc. (+2 coins bonus)

**Why this matters**: People search by instrument and timeframe. Threads with metadata show up in filtered searches. Plus you earn bonus coins!

### 3. Include One Clear Question

Don't ramble. State your question directly:

**Examples:**
- "How do I prevent this EA from opening multiple trades at once?"
- "Which broker gives the tightest XAUUSD spreads during London session?"
- "Is 40% drawdown acceptable for a grid EA on EURUSD?"

One question per thread keeps replies focused. Multiple questions split attention and reduce helpful answers.

### 4. Add Screenshots or Charts

Visuals get 3x more engagement:
- **Chart screenshots**: Show entries, exits, indicators
- **EA settings**: Screenshot your input parameters
- **Backtest results**: Show profit graph and statistics
- **Error messages**: Screenshot the exact error

**How to attach**: When creating thread, click "Attach Files" and upload .jpg or .png (+3 coins bonus for adding visual proof)

### 5. Use Smart Tags (2-5 Tags)

**Good tags (specific):**
- #XAUUSD, #scalping, #MT5, #grid-trading, #ICMarkets

**Bad tags (too generic):**
- #trading, #forex, #help, #question

Tags help people discover your thread when browsing categories or searching. Use exact terms traders search for.

### 6. Link to 2-3 Related Threads

Show you did research:

"I tried the approach from [this thread](link) but got different results..."

"Similar to [this discussion](link), but my EA uses a trailing stop..."

**Why this works:**
- Shows you're not lazy
- Helps others discover related content
- Earns you +2 bonus coins
- More likely to get quality replies

### 7. Share Results (Not Just Promises)

**Instead of**: "I'm testing a great EA"  
**Write**: "Tested this EA on XAUUSD M5 demo for 5 days – 12 trades, 8 wins, 4 losses, 6% gain"

Specifics attract replies. Vague claims get ignored.

### 8. Post in the Right Category

Don't post in "General Discussion" when there's a specific category:
- EA question → EA Library
- Broker issue → Broker Reviews
- MQL code help → Coding & Development
- Backtest results → Trading Journals

Right category = right audience = better answers faster.

## Posting Time Matters

**Best times (UTC):**
- 08:00-10:00 (European morning)
- 13:00-15:00 (US morning, EU afternoon overlap)
- 20:00-22:00 (US evening, Asian early morning)

**Worst times:**
- Weekends (less activity)
- 00:00-06:00 UTC (low traffic)

Post when active traders are online. You'll get replies within hours, not days.

## After Posting: Stay Active

1. **Reply to comments quickly**: First hour matters most. If someone asks a question, answer fast. Active threads stay visible longer.

2. **Update with new info**: Did you fix it? Found more data? Edit your post or add a reply with updates. This bumps your thread.

3. **Mark accepted answer**: When someone solves your problem, mark their reply as "accepted answer". They get +15 coins, you show appreciation, and future readers know which solution worked.

4. **Don't bump excessively**: Replying "anyone?" every hour annoys people. Give it 24 hours before bumping with new information.

## Mini-FAQ

**Q: Should I post the same thread in multiple categories?**  
A: No, that's spam. Pick the most relevant category. Moderators can move it if needed.

**Q: Can I edit my title after posting?**  
A: Yes, within 24 hours. Click the three dots (•••) on your post → Edit.

**Q: What if nobody replies after 2 days?**  
A: Add new information (more screenshots, backtest results, what you tried since posting). This bumps the thread and shows effort.

**Q: Should I offer coins for help?**  
A: You don't need to. Helpful community members answer for reputation and upvotes. But if you want, you can mention "will tip 50 coins for working solution" to attract attention.

**Q: How many threads can I post per day?**  
A: No hard limit, but quality over quantity. 2-3 well-crafted threads beat 10 rushed ones.

## End Note

If your thread still isn't getting traction after following these steps, ask in **General Discussion** with a link to your thread. Sometimes a fresh perspective helps reframe your question.
