# Verified Brokers

What does "verified" mean? Which brokers made the list? How do we decide? Here's everything you need to know about YoForex broker verification.

## Quick Wins

- **Verified = real regulation checked** – we confirm licenses ourselves
- **Updated monthly** – list refreshes as regulations change
- **Community-rated** – real traders add reviews and ratings
- **Scam Watch integrated** – reported brokers get flagged fast
- **Multi-platform support** – MT4, MT5, and mobile compatibility noted

## What "Verified" Means

1. **We check regulation licenses**: We don't just take a broker's word for it. We verify their regulatory license with FCA, ASIC, CySEC, or other recognized authorities. If we can't confirm it, they don't get the badge.

2. **Active and operational**: Verified brokers are currently accepting clients and processing withdrawals. If a broker stops operating or gets license suspended, we remove verification immediately.

3. **Community feedback reviewed**: We monitor reviews continuously. If multiple traders report withdrawal issues or scams, we investigate and may remove verification even if regulation is valid.

4. **Platform confirmation**: We verify that the broker offers the trading platforms they claim (MT4, MT5, cTrader, etc.) and that those platforms are stable.

5. **Spread accuracy**: We spot-check spreads during different market conditions. If advertised spreads don't match reality, we note it in the profile.

## How We Verify

1. **Regulation check**: We visit the regulator's website and search their public register for the broker's license number. If found and active, we proceed.

2. **Website audit**: We check the broker's official website for transparency: clear terms, withdrawal policy, contact info, and legal documents accessible.

3. **Community input**: We review recent community ratings and complaints. Pattern of issues? We investigate further or delay verification.

4. **Platform testing**: We open demo accounts to test platform stability, order execution, and spread accuracy during volatile market conditions.

5. **Monthly review**: Every verified broker gets reviewed monthly. Regulation changes, user complaints, or operational issues trigger re-evaluation.

## What Verification Doesn't Mean

**Verification is NOT:**
- A guarantee you'll make money
- An endorsement of specific trading strategies
- Protection against your own trading losses
- A promise of perfect execution or zero slippage
- Insurance against broker bankruptcy or regulatory changes

**Verification IS:**
- Confirmation of legitimate regulation
- Evidence of operational stability
- Signal of community trust
- Indicator of transparent business practices

## Mini-FAQ

**Q: Can I trust all verified brokers equally?**  
A: Verification means they meet basic standards, but you should still research based on your needs. ECN brokers differ from market makers. Compare spreads, commissions, and platforms.

**Q: What if my broker isn't verified?**  
A: It doesn't automatically mean they're bad. They might be new, small, or we haven't reviewed them yet. Check their regulation yourself and read community reviews.

**Q: How do I report a broker issue?**  
A: Use the "Report Scam" button on the broker's page. Provide evidence: dates, ticket numbers, screenshots (blur personal info). We investigate all reports.

**Q: Why did a broker lose verification?**  
A: Common reasons: license suspended, multiple withdrawal complaints, platform instability, or misleading advertising. We post updates when this happens.

**Q: Can brokers pay for verification?**  
A: No. Verification is free and based only on regulation and community trust. Brokers cannot buy verified status.
