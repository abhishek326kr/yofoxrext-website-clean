# Report a Scam

Spotted a scam broker, fake EA, or dishonest seller? Your report protects the community. Here's what evidence to collect, what to blur, and how to stay factual.

## Quick Wins

- **Evidence first** – collect dates, amounts, tickets, screenshots
- **Blur sensitive info** – account numbers, personal IDs, full names if needed
- **Stay factual** – describe what happened, not emotions
- **Document timeline** – when you paid, when issues started
- **Include attempts to resolve** – show you contacted them first

## What Evidence to Collect

### For Broker Scams

**Required:**
- Account number (blur last few digits in screenshots)
- Deposit/withdrawal dates and amounts
- Support ticket numbers
- Email correspondence (headers showing dates)
- Screenshots of trading terminal showing issues
- Screenshots of website claims vs reality

**Helpful:**
- Bank/payment processor transaction IDs
- IP address and server logs if available
- Regulation claims (screenshot their "regulated by" page)
- Terms of service screenshots (if changed unexpectedly)

### For Fake EA/Indicator Scams

**Required:**
- Purchase date and amount (coins or USD)
- Seller username and listing link
- Screenshots of advertised claims
- Screenshots of actual results
- Settings you used (screenshot of EA inputs)
- Backtest vs live results comparison

**Helpful:**
- MyFXBook or statement screenshots showing losses
- Chat logs with seller (if they promised specific results)
- Version number of EA/indicator
- Platform used (MT4 or MT5)

### For Fake Signal Services

**Required:**
- Subscription date and amount
- Signal provider's claims (win rate, drawdown, etc.)
- Actual results from following signals
- Screenshots of their signal history
- Screenshots of your trades following signals

**Helpful:**
- Timeline of profitable vs losing periods
- Evidence of edited signal history
- Screenshots of their marketing materials

## What to Blur (Privacy Protection)

**Always blur:**
- Full account numbers (show first 2-3 digits only)
- Government-issued ID numbers
- Full legal names (yours or others if not public scammers)
- Credit card numbers (even expired ones)
- Full addresses
- Phone numbers (except public support lines)
- Email addresses (except official support emails)

**Keep visible:**
- Dates and times
- Amounts and currencies
- Usernames (public platform usernames)
- Broker/company names
- Transaction IDs (if non-sensitive)
- Support ticket numbers

**How to blur**: Use your device's built-in photo editor or free tools like Photopea. Draw a solid rectangle over sensitive info. Don't use transparent blur—that can be reversed.

## How to Stay Factual

**Good (factual) reporting:**
"I deposited $500 on January 15, 2025. Submitted withdrawal request on February 1, 2025 for $650. As of February 20, still pending. Support tickets #12345 and #12389 remain unanswered for 15+ days. Broker website claims 1-3 business day withdrawals."

**Bad (emotional) reporting:**
"This broker STOLE my money! They're SCAMMERS! Don't trust them! I lost everything because of these THIEVES!"

**Why factual is better:**
- More credible
- Easier for moderators to verify
- Harder to dispute
- Helps future users make informed decisions

## What to Include in Your Report

- Feb 10: Follow-up ticket #12389 sent

## Mini-FAQ

**Q: Will the scammer know I reported them?**  
A: They'll see a public "Scam Watch" flag on their listing if verified, but your username isn't automatically disclosed. You can choose to post anonymously.

**Q: Can I get my money back?**  
A: Platform can remove listings and ban users, but we can't force refunds. For broker issues, contact your payment processor or regulatory authority. For marketplace issues, sellers may voluntarily refund if their reputation matters to them.

**Q: What if my report is wrong?**  
A: Honest mistakes happen. If new evidence shows your report was inaccurate, you can edit or retract it. But false reports made maliciously result in account suspension.

**Q: Should I report suspected scams or wait until confirmed?**  
A: Report suspicious behavior early, but mark it as "possible scam" vs "confirmed scam". Early warnings help others avoid issues.

**Q: How long does verification take?**  
A: Usually 24-72 hours depending on evidence complexity. Straightforward cases (obvious fake results) resolve faster.

## End Note

If you're unsure whether something qualifies as a scam or just a business dispute, ask in **Broker Reviews → General Broker Discussion** first. The community can help you determine if it's report-worthy or just bad service.
