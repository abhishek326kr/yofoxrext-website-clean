### Migration Plans (4 files - 2,263 lines)
❌ `NEXTJS_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`  
❌ `REACT_TO_NEXTJS_COPY_PLAN.md`  
❌ `NEXTJS_MIGRATION_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`

### Implementation Docs (3 files - 1,779 lines)
❌ `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`  
❌ `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`

### Test Results (2 files - 365 lines)
❌ `API_TEST_RESULTS.md`

❌ `TESTING_PLAN.md`  
❌ `NEXTJS_TESTING_GUIDE.md`

### "I need API documentation"
→ Go to **docs/API_REFERENCE.md**

### "I want to understand all features"
→ Read **docs/PLATFORM_GUIDE.md**

## ✨ Future Maintenance

### What to Update
1. **replit.md** - Keep as Replit Agent memory (update after major changes)
2. **README.md** - Update when adding new major features
3. **docs/PLATFORM_GUIDE.md** - Update when features change
4. **docs/ARCHITECTURE.md** - Update when tech stack changes
5. **docs/API_REFERENCE.md** - Update when endpoints change
6. **docs/DEPLOYMENT.md** - Update when deployment process changes

### What NOT to Create
❌ Don't create new "IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN" files  
❌ Don't create new "STATUS_SUMMARY" files  
❌ Don't create migration plans for small changes  
❌ Don't duplicate information across files  

**Rule:** Keep documentation minimal but comprehensive. Every file should have a clear purpose and be actively maintained.
