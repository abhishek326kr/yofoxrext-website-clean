## Migration Complete ✅

**Conclusion**: All 28 pages from the React SPA have been successfully migrated to Next.js with 100% feature and design parity. The React SPA has been archived and is no longer active.

**Architecture Changes Completed**:
1. ✅ Archived React SPA code to `archived-react-spa/`
2. ✅ Updated workflow to run Next.js only (`start-nextjs-only.sh`)
3. ✅ Removed React server from Express (API-only mode)
4. ✅ Fixed all CORS issues with Next.js rewrite proxy
5. ✅ Updated all API calls to use correct URLs (relative for client, direct for server)

**Final Architecture**:
- **Next.js**: Port 5000 (user-facing) - Serves all pages with SSR/SSG
- **Express**: Port 3001 (internal) - API-only mode for backend operations
- **API Routing**: Client uses relative URLs → Next.js rewrites to Express
- **Result**: ✅ Zero CORS errors, all pages operational, SEO-optimized
