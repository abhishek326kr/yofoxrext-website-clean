## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### 1. React Hydration Errors (CRITICAL)
**Status**: ‚ùå ACTIVE  
**Impact**: Causes unnecessary re-renders, poor performance, potential bugs  
**Location**: Homepage and multiple components  
**Priority**: P0 - MUST FIX TONIGHT

**Error Message**:
```
Error: Hydration failed because the server rendered text didn't match the client.
```

**Common Causes**:
- Date/time formatting differences between server/client
- Dynamic content using `Date.now()` or `Math.random()`
- Browser-specific code running on server
- Conditional rendering based on `typeof window`

**Action Plan**:
- [ ] Search for all Date.now() usage
- [ ] Search for all Math.random() usage
- [ ] Search for all `typeof window` checks
- [ ] Search for relative time formatting ("1 day ago", etc.)
- [ ] Fix all hydration mismatches
