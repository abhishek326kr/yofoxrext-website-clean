## 🔧 Backend Improvements

### API Endpoint: `/api/user/:username/profile`

**Fixed Issues:**

1. ✅ **Follower Count** - Now calculates real follower count
   ```typescript
   const followers = await storage.getUserFollowers(user.id);
   stats.followers = followers.length; // Previously hardcoded to 0
   ```

2. ✅ **Following Count** - Now calculates real following count
   ```typescript
   const following = await storage.getUserFollowing(user.id);
   stats.following = following.length; // Previously hardcoded to 0
   ```

**API Response Structure:**
```typescript
{
  user: UserType,
  isFollowing: boolean,
  badges: Badge[],
  content: Content[],
  stats: {
    followers: number,      // ✅ Real data
    following: number,      // ✅ Real data
    posts: number,
    content: number,
    totalRevenue: number,
    totalSales: number,
    averageRating: number,
    totalDownloads: number
  },
  reviews: Review[],
  ratingBreakdown: {
    averageRating: number,
    totalReviews: number,
    breakdown: { 5: n, 4: n, 3: n, 2: n, 1: n }
  }
}
```
