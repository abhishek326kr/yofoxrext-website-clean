## Verification Steps

### To verify the testing infrastructure:

1. **Run unit tests:**
   ```bash
   npx vitest run server/services/__tests__/retention.test.ts
   ```
   Expected: All 15 tests pass

2. **Check test configuration:**
   ```bash
   cat vitest.config.ts
   ```
   Expected: Valid Vitest config with TypeScript paths

3. **Verify performance script:**
   ```bash
   cat scripts/performance-audit.ts
   ```
   Expected: Complete audit script with 6 endpoints

4. **Review test report:**
   ```bash
   cat docs/RETENTION_DASHBOARD_TEST_REPORT.md
   ```
   Expected: 12-section comprehensive report
